      "question": "To politely call/address the waiter/waitress, it is best to use the greeting ___.",
      "options": [
        "A. Salut",
        "B. Bonjour ou Bonsoir",
        "C. Serveur ou Serveuse",
        "D. No greeting. Just starting a sentence."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B. Bonjour ou Bonsoir",
      "explanation": "Polite greetings like \"Bonjour ou Bonsoir\" are customary when addressing the waiter. While the other options include greetings, they lack the appropriate formality and cultural resonance needed in a polite conversation. Cultural tip: In France, it is polite to greet people with a \"Bonjour\" (in the morning or during the day) or a \"Bonsoir\" (in the evening) when entering a public place or starting a conversation."

        "D. Puis-je commander un café et une viennoiserie?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A. Un café et un croissant, s'il vous plait.",
      "explanation": "Using s'il vous plait expresses your request politely in a typical French café conversation. While the other options convey similar intentions, they lack the specific politeness and common usage found in everyday French. You can say Bonjour as well if you have not said it yet."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D. Mes deux cafés littéraires préférés sont les Deux Magots et le Café de Flore.",
      "explanation": "Les Deux Magots et le Café de Flore are renowned literary cafés frequented by celebrated writers. But be careful, the service can be a bit outdated sometimes (not the most attentive). Les Deux Magots was named after Les Deux Magots de la Chine (two statues representing Chinese \"mandarins,\" or \"magicians\" who gaze serenely over the room and keep an eye on things), this cultural landmark cafe is facing the Café de Flore. Café de Flore was opened in the 1880s, its name comes from a sculpture of Flora, the goddess of flowers and the season of spring in Roman mythology."

        "D. With spices, please."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C. With sugar, please.",
      "explanation": "When in France, asking for sugar is as simple as saying \"C. Avec du sucre, s'il vous plait.\" Before the introduction of sugar in the 12th century, mediaeval European cuisine relied on alternative sweeteners such as honey and fruits to add sweetness to dishes and beverages."

It refers to an espresso that's been diluted with hot water, resulting in a milder taste and a larger volume compared to a traditional espresso shot. However, it's still served in a smaller cup than a typical American coffee."

      "explanation": "Corsé describes something with a strong flavor or body. A \"café corsé\" translates to \"strong coffee\" or \"full-bodied coffee.\" It can also be used for sauces or wines. The profile of French roast coffee is: Intense and bold, Very dark (nearly burnt, often smoky), Somewhat sweet, Much less acidic than lighter roasts, Thin in body, with a more watery mouthfeel than some coffees. Only speciality coffee shops will offer French roast coffees. It's very unlikely to find it in regular cafés."
